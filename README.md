# Bluetooth Peer-to-Peer Text Messenger

This Android application enables real-time, **one-to-one** text communication between two Bluetooth-paired devices using classic Bluetooth (RFCOMM). 
It works entirely offline and does not require an internet connection.

## Features

-  **Peer-to-peer communication** via Bluetooth
-  **One-to-one text chat only** (no group or broadcast)
-  **Offline support** â€“ no Wi-Fi or mobile data needed
-  Secure pairing using system Bluetooth settings
-  Minimal and intuitive UI
-  Basic connection status indicators (Paired, Connected)

## How It Works

- One device starts in **server mode** and listens for incoming Bluetooth connections.
- Another device acts as the **client** and initiates the connection.
- Once connected, a socket-based stream allows for real-time message exchange.
- Messages are sent using `BluetoothSocket` and displayed on the UI using a `RecyclerView`.

## Prerequisites

- Android device with Bluetooth capability
- Android Studio installed
- Minimum SDK: 21 (Lollipop)
